                    <h4>How much the US import?</h4>
                    <p>California currently supplies less than 3% of the olive oil consumed in the U.S. Countries. U.S. producing states include California, Georgia, Arizona, Florida, Oregon and Texas. As demand for olive oil has increased dramatically since the 1990s, California’s olive oil acreage has grown.  This growth has been aided in recent years by mechanical harvesters and high density plantings. According to the Agricultural Issues Center, University of California, production of olives for olive oil in California has increased from 5,000 tons of olives in 1999 to 74,000 tons of olives in 2012.</p>
